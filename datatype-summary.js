//Datatypes in JavaScript - Javascript data types are mainly divided how they are stored in the memory and how we access the value from the memory. 

// Primitive Datatype - Call by value - Number, String, Symbol, Null, Boolean, BigInt, Undefined.

// Non Primitive Datatype - Call by reference - Arrays, Objects, Functions. 

//Javascript is a loosely typed language because we never define what type of data will be assigned to the variable when we initialize it.

//JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
